        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Grass Fed, 12-16oz Top Sirloin Steak</li>
            <li>One diced Garlic Clove</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp of Butter or Butter Substitute</li>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring that steak out in the open and pat it dry with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Now coat both sides with plenty of Salt and Pepper.</li>
            <li>Let the steak rest for about 10 minutes to bring it to room temp. 
                This is to avoid undercooking the meat.</li>
            <li>Set a pan (Cast Iron Skillet works best!) on the stove at Medium Heat.</li>
            <li>Apply a nice thin layer of your Extra Virgin Olive Oil to the Pan. Deep
                enough to cover about 1/8th of the bottom of the steak. Don't add the steak
                just yet!
            </li>
            <li>Once the oil barely starts to smoke, throw that meat in there! 
                (Carfully of course)
            </li>
            <li>Add your choice of Butter to the pan, allowing it to fully melt.</li>
            <li>Add the diced Garlic and use a ladle to cover the steak with butter 
                and Garlic.
            </li>
            <li>After 5 minutes, flip steak and repeat the ladling process.</li>
            <li>After another 5 minutes, remove the steak and place it on a plate
                and allow it to rest for 5 minutes. This allows the muscle fibers to relax
                which results in a more tender steak.
            </li>
            <li>Dig in! Pair with your favorite Whiskey for bonus points!</li>

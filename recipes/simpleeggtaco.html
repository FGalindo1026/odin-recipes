        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tsp of Butter or Butter Substitute</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>1 Corn Tortilla</li>
            <li>Salt for Taste</li>
            <li>Pepper for Taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First set a Medium Sized Pan on quarter heat.</li>
            <li>While that's warming up, toss that butter on there.</li>
            <li>To Help that Butter melt, use a tortilla to spread it, then flip it.</li>
            <li>Immediately crack one egg on top of the tortilla, try to keep it on top.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some Salt & Pepper on that egg for some taste.</li>
            <li>Then set a lid over the pan to keep the heat in. This helps cook
                everything while achieving a nice warm runny yolk.
            </li>
            <li>After 5 minutes, slide that boy on plate and add any garnish you like!</li>
        </ol>
